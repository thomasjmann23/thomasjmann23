# Hi, I'm Thomas Mann

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a data-driven developer focused on Generative AI, currently based in Madrid and completing my Master’s in Business Analytics and Data Science at IE University with a specialization in Advanced AI.

My work bridges automation, machine learning, and financial systems. I have hands-on experience building apps with LLMs, RAG pipelines, and OCR-based automation tools. I enjoy taking ideas from concept to deployment using open source tools.

## Current Focus

- Generative AI applications using LLMs  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LangChain and FAISS  
- Building financial tools powered by NLP  
- Continual learning in MLOps and large-scale model deployment  

## Featured Projects

### SEC RAG Insights  
A Streamlit app that extracts SEC 10-K filings and uses Gemini and LangChain to generate insights from key-value pairs. Built for competitive intelligence and financial analysis.  
**Tech:** Python, LangChain, Gemini, FAISS, Streamlit, SEC EDGAR API

### Credit Scoring with LLMs  
A machine learning model for credit risk scoring integrated with an LLM to enhance interpretability and portfolio-level risk insight.  
**Tech:** Python, Scikit-learn, LLM APIs, Pandas, SQL

### Automated Credit Memos  
Automated generation of SBA credit memos and commitment letters using VBA and Python with LLM input. Reduced manual effort and streamlined underwriting.  
**Tech:** VBA, Python, OpenAI API
