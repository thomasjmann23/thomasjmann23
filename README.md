# Hi, I'm Thomas Mann

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a data-driven developer focused on Generative AI, currently based in Madrid and completing my Master’s in Business Analytics and Data Science at IE University with a specialization in Advanced AI.

My work bridges automation, machine learning, and financial systems. I have hands-on experience building apps with LLMs, RAG pipelines, and OCR-based automation tools. I enjoy streamlining processes, taking ideas from concept to deployment. 

## Current Focus

- Generative AI applications using LLMs  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation 
- Using LLMs & NLP to make internal process decisions   
- Continual learning in MLOps and large-scale model deployment  

## Featured Projects
### [DeepDiligence: SEC RAG Insights](https://deepdiligence.streamlit.app/)
A Streamlit app that extracts SEC 10-K filings and uses Gemini and LangChain to generate insights from key-value pairs. Built for competitive intelligence and financial analysis.  
**Tech:** Python, LangChain, Gemini, FAISS, Streamlit, SEC EDGAR API, HTML/CSS

### [Ecolog-IA ESG Risk Assessment](https://ecolog-ia.streamlit.app/)
An AI-powered ESG risk assessment platform that uses IoT smart grid data to provide real-time environmental scoring and risk classification. Features machine learning models trained on IoT sensor data for transparent, data-driven ESG ratings.
- **Dashboard:** Real-time risk monitoring with interactive visualizations and project classification
- **Assessment Tool:** Individual project ESG scoring with personalized recommendations
- **ML Analysis:** Random Forest model with feature importance analysis and performance metrics
**Tech:** Python, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Pandas, IoT Data Processing, HTML/CSS

### [Legal Interpreter](https://nlpproject-cbd6fd7gjgme7x5jwcltb5.streamlit.app/)
An NLP application that allows users to ask legal questions in any language about any country.
- Query Pipeline: Detects the input language and target country, translates the question into the target language, retrieves the top-matching sections from the country's civil code using TF-IDF, summarizes results with Gemini, and translates the answer back to the original language.
- Civil Code Ingestion: Uploads and processes civil code PDFs—parsing, chunking, and vectorizing them (TF-IDF) for accurate legal retrieval.
**Tech:** Python, NLP, TF-IDF, Gemini, Streamlit, PDF Processing, Multi-language Support

### Automated Credit Memos  
Lead a team of interns to automate the generation of SBA credit memos and commitment letters using VBA and Python with LLM input. Reduced manual effort and streamlined underwriting.
