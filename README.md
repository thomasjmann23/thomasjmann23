# Hi, I'm Thomas Mann

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a data-driven developer focused on Generative AI, currently based in Madrid and completing my Master’s in Business Analytics and Data Science at IE University with a specialization in Advanced AI.

My work bridges automation, machine learning, and financial systems. I have hands-on experience building apps with LLMs, RAG pipelines, and OCR-based automation tools. I enjoy streamlining processes, taking ideas from concept to deployment. 

## Current Focus

- Generative AI applications using LLMs  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation 
- Building financial tools powered by NLP  
- Continual learning in MLOps and large-scale model deployment  

## Featured Projects

### SEC RAG Insights  
A Streamlit app that extracts SEC 10-K filings and uses Gemini and LangChain to generate insights from key-value pairs. Built for competitive intelligence and financial analysis.  
**Tech:** Python, LangChain, Gemini, FAISS, Streamlit, SEC EDGAR API

### Legal Interpreter & RAG Engine
An NLP application that allows users to ask legal questions in any language about any country.
- Query Pipeline: Detects the input language and target country, translates the question into the target language, retrieves the top-matching sections from the country’s civil code using TF-IDF, summarizes results with Gemini, and translates the answer back to the original language.
- Civil Code Ingestion: Uploads and processes civil code PDFs—parsing, chunking, and vectorizing them (TF-IDF) for accurate legal retrieval.

### Automated Credit Memos  
Lead a team of interns to automate the generation of SBA credit memos and commitment letters using VBA and Python with LLM input. Reduced manual effort and streamlined underwriting.  
**Tech:** VBA, Python, OpenAI API
